Chocolate-Wolfenstein-3D
========================

![alt tag](screenshots/crt_aspect.png)

This is a fork of Fabien Sanglard's [Chocolate-Wolfenstein-3D](https://github.com/fabiensanglard/Chocolate-Wolfenstein-3D) which upgrades the codebase to use SDL2 and makes some
other small changes.

* Now using CMake for cross-platform builds.
* Replaces OpenGL code with the SDL2 renderer for CRT emulation.
* Support for modern game controllers (Xbox, PS3/PS4, etc) via the SDL2 GameController API.
    * When using a modern game controller, the game supports moving and strafing at the same time. 

This is still a WIP. Things I'm planning to do:
- [ ] Detailed instructions for how to build for each platform (via command line, and CLion IDE).
- [ ] Ports to other platforms/game consoles (PSP, PS Vita, etc).

## Build & Run

### Data Files

First copy your Wolf3D data files into the `data` directory. The files needed are:

```
AUDIOHED
AUDIOT
GAMEMAPS
MAPHEAD
VGADICT
VGAGRAPH
VGAHEAD
VSWAP
```

The data files can have the following extensions:

* .WL1 - Wolfenstein 3D shareware version (episode 1 only)
* .WL6 - Wolfenstein 3D full version (episode 1 to 6)
* .SOD - Wolfenstein 3D Spear of Destiny demo and full version
* .SD2 - Wolfenstein 3D Spear of Destiny Mission 2: Return to Danger
* .SD3 - Wolfenstein 3D Spear of Destiny Mission 3: Ultimate Challenge

You will need to ensure the game is configured for your version of the data files. You can do this by enabling specific
definitions in the `version.h` file, which has some comments with instructions about what to configure. By default the game is configured for the `.WL1` and `.WL6` data files.

If you don't have data files, here are some links:

* [Shareware files for Spear of Destiny](http://maniacsvault.net/ecwolf/files/shareware/soddemo.zip)

### OSX

These instructions assume you have Homebrew installed. If you don't, please [install](https://brew.sh/) it.

Install all of the required dependencies:

```shell
brew update
brew install cmake sdl2 sdl2_mixer
```

Generate the build files:

```shell
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
```

Compile the game:

```shell
make -j4
```

Run the game:

```shell
./Chocolate-Wolfenstein-3D
```

### Game Controller Support

With the help of the SDL2 GameController API the game now supports modern controllers (Xbox 360, Xbox One, PS3/PS4, etc).

Here is the button layout for controllers. This is not currently customizable.
